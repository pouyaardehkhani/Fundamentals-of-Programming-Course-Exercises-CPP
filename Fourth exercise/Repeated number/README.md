# question
**Duplicate number**, we have a list of n random numbers, we want to find the element that is repeated in this list more than half the length of the list, if any. You must write a program that takes this list of numbers and prints it if there is such an element in the output, otherwise it prints None. The number of input numbers is between 1 and 10 to the power of 7.
# example:

## Sample input 1:
```
13
17 89 3 3 0 4 3 3 90 3 3 32 3
```
## Sample output 1:
```
3
```
## Sample input 2:
```
10
2 5 67 5 5 91 13 5 10 91
```
## Sample output 2:
```
None
```
