# question
Define a function with the same name fibo 3 times (using the Polymorphism feature in C ++). If the input of the function is 2 integers, print the number of Fibonacci numbers between them. If the input to function 1 is integer, print Fibonacci numbers from 1 to that number. And if it has no input, print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers. (In all 3 functions, use the return method to find Fibonacci numbers) (Note: If you do not follow the functions with the same name and return method, your score will be deducted)
# input
Two natural numbers a and b between 1 and 20
# output
Includes 3 lines, the first line of Fibonacci numbers from the first number received to the second number received by calling the function of two arguments, the second line contains the Fibonacci numbers from 1 as 1,1,2, ... to the larger number received by calling the function of one Argument, and the third line contains the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence starting from 1,1,2 .. which must be done by calling the function without argument.
# example:

## Sample input 1:
```
5 15
```
## Sample output 1:
```
5 8 13
1 1 2 3 5 8 13
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55
```
