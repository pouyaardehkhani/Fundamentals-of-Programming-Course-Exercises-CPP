1) Write the value of the variables after each line and upload them in pdf format.
```
int a = 30, b = 18;
int c = a | b;
int d = a & b;
int e = c ^ d;
int f = e >> 2;
float z = f * 5.2;
```
2) Score question: Using the namespace feature, define two variables with the same name but with different values.
