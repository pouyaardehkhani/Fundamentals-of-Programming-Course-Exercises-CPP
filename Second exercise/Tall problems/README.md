#question
Massoud is a big teenager and his height and weight are high. This is why it is always difficult to get through the doors (usually the doors that are high are small, the width is small and the doors that are big are short).

Now Massoud wants to buy a house and has taken the width and height at the entrance of the house from the landlord and wants to know if he can pass through the house or not and asks you to help solve this problem.

Note that Massoud always enters the house smoothly and does not show any flexibility to go through the door.
#input
The entrance consists of two lines, in the first line the width and height (w, h) in the house are given and in the second line the width and height (f, t) are given.
#output
In the only output line, you have to say whether the new house is suitable for Massoud or not. If yes, output yes, and if not, output no.
#example:

##Sample input 1:
```
34 30
34 15
```
##Sample output 1:
```
yes
```
##Sample input 2:
```
34 30
33 68
```
##Sample output 2:
```
no
```
