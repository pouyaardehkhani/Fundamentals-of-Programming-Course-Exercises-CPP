# question
Laden has just become the president of the league and wants to organize the teams in the league and design a symbol for them. Since every team has been competing for many years and has won many honors, this symbol should be worthy of any team. That's why he uses his mind to create a new design with an asterisk. The design is such that the stars fill the rhombus border with equal diameters in the form of a strip. The diameter of the rhombus is equal to 2n + 1, which indicates the number of years the team has been in the league, and the width of this bar is equal to k, which indicates the honors that each team has achieved so far. But Laden does not know how to prepare each symbol for the team. Write a program that prints Laden's design by taking n and k.
# input
