# question
Write a program that receives a natural 4 or 5 digit number from the user and prints the number in the first line as a mirror and then in each line to that number, receiving the number from the user and calculating and printing the requested value until 0 Enter and continue. In case of receiving undesirable input, "error" will be printed. (Input number can also have 0) (You can use the cmath library power function to shorten the code)
# input
The input is between 1 and a few lines consisting of 4 or 5 digit numbers until 0 is entered.
# output
It varies depending on the number of inputs given. Print "error" if the input does not meet the required conditions.
